                        Hello! I'm {resumeData.name}, a Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo. My journey in tech is fueled by a fascination with building intelligent software that solves real-world problems.
                    </p>
                    <p className="mb-4">
                        I approach development as both an art and a scienceâ€”a discipline that requires rigorous logic and a creative spark. I love diving deep into code, but I'm equally passionate about understanding the "why" behind the "what," ensuring that every project I undertake has a meaningful impact.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outside of coding, you can find me choreographing dance routines or playing my guitar. These creative outlets balance my analytical side and constantly inspire new ways of thinking.
